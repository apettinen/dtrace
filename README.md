# Sample Dtrace scripts for macOS

Due to System Integrity Protection (SIP) in macOS, you must enable DTrace by booting into recovery mode (cmd+r), starting terminal, and either disabling SIP altogether by running `csrutil disable` or alternatively using experimental option `csrutil enable --without dtrace` (after you have first disabled SIP).
